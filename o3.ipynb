It simply means that the two coins behave as one combined system no matter how far apart they are.  Entanglement is the basis for technologies like quantum computing, ultra-secure communication, and certain precision sensors.\n",

It involves correlations that are stronger than classical methods, and I should clarify that measurements create instant correlations without transferring information. Quantum computing and cryptography utilize this concept. I can use a coin analogy to explain spins and mention EPR while noting that measurements are still random individually. Let’s keep it concise!\n",

There's nothing too complicated here, which is nice! I just need to state it clearly: the answer is 27. Simple math problems like this can be refreshing!\n"
