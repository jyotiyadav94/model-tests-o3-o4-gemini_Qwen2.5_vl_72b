# Vision Model Testing

This repository is dedicated to testing and comparing the **vision capabilities** of several advanced AI models:

- **o3**
- **o4-mini**
- **geemini 2.5 pro**

---

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to evaluate how these models perform on various vision-related tasks, such as:

- Image understanding
- Image captioning
- Visual question answering
- Multimodal content processing (combining text and images)

By running controlled tests and benchmarks, we aim to analyze their strengths and limitations in handling visual inputs.
